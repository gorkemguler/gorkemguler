### 🧠 About Me

- 🎯 I specialize in cyber threat intelligence, threat hunting, and building automation systems for security operations.  
- 🧩 I develop operational solutions for phishing detection, brand impersonation, credential leak investigation, and deep/dark web analysis.  
- 🛠️ My focus is on scalable, data-driven, and automated systems that empower cybersecurity teams and reduce manual workload.  
- 📊 I turn open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques into actionable insights for early threat detection and mitigation.
